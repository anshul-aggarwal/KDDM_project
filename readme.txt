Code:

The structure is self explanatory. The classifier uses XGBoost to train the model using data from the file train_v2.csv, and predicts the article categories for test data reccords in test_v2.csv. The run.py file is complete in itself, and does not require any custom data/custom dependencies.

Instructions:

1. Place the training and test files in the same directory along with the run.py file.
2. Simply execute the code using the command "python run.py"
3. The predictions will be generated in a file called predictions.csv in the same directory.

No custom data required, hence the data/ directory is not required.

Dependencies:

No custom dependencies, hence no code/ directory, but needs the following standard packages to run:
1. nltk
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. sklearn
5. xgboost
6. scipy
